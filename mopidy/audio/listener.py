        Target state is used to when we should be in the target state, but
        temporarily need to switch to an other state. A typical example of this
        is buffering. When this happens an event with

        caught up a `old=PAUSED, new=PLAYING, target=None` event will be
        be generated.

        Regular state changes will not have target state set as they are final
        states which should be stable.
