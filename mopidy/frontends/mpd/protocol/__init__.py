This is Mopidy's MPD protocol implementation.

This is partly based upon the `MPD protocol documentation
<http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/>`_, which is a useful resource, but it is
rather incomplete with regards to data formats, both for requests and
responses. Thus, we have had to talk a great deal with the the original `MPD
server <http://mpd.wikia.com/>`_ using telnet to get the details we need to
implement our own MPD server which is compatible with the numerous existing
`MPD clients <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients>`_.
