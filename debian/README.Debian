Mopidy for Debian
-----------------

The upstream Mopidy docs includes a section on the Mopidy Debian package and
how it differs from Mopidy installed from source.

The most up to date instructions can be found at
<http://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/debian/>.

Alternatively, install the mopidy-doc package and read
/usr/share/doc/mopidy-doc/html/debian.html.
