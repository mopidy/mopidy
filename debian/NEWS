mopidy (0.19.4-3) unstable; urgency=medium

    Mopidy no longer reads configuration files in
    /etc/mopidy/extensions.d. If you've previously configured anything in
    /etc/mopidy/extensions.d, you should move the configuration to
    /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf. Debian packages of Mopidy extensions should
    install their default configuration into /usr/share/mopidy/conf.d.
