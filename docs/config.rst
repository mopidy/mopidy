Configuration
*************

Mopidy has a lot of config values you can tweak, but you only need to change a
few to get up and running. A complete :file:`~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf` may
be as simple as this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [mpd]
    hostname = ::

    [spotify]
    username = alice
    password = mysecret

Mopidy primarily reads config from the file
:file:`~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf`, where ``~`` means your *home directory*.
If your username is ``alice`` and you are running Linux, the config file should
probably be at :file:`/home/alice/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf`. You can either
create the configuration file yourself, or run the ``mopidy`` command, and it
will create an empty config file for you and print what config values must be
set to successfully start Mopidy.

When you have created the configuration file, open it in a text editor, and add
the config values you want to change. If you want to keep the default for a
config value, you **should not** add it to
:file:`~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf`.

To see what's the effective configuration for your Mopidy installation, you can
run :option:`mopidy --show-config`. It will print your full effective config
with passwords masked out so that you safely can share the output with others
for debugging.

You can find a description of all config values belonging to Mopidy's core
below, together with their default values. In addition, all :ref:`extensions
<ext>` got additional config values. The extension's config values and config
defaults are documented on the :ref:`extension pages <ext>`.


Migrating from pre 0.14
=======================

For those users upgrading from versions prior to 0.14 we made
the :option:`mopidy-convert-config` tool, to ease the process of migrating
settings to the new config format.


Default core configuration
==========================

.. literalinclude:: ../mopidy/config/default.conf
    :language: ini


Core configuration values
=========================

.. confval:: audio/mixer

    Audio mixer to use.

    Expects a GStreamer mixer to use, typical values are: ``software``,
    ``autoaudiomixer``, ``alsamixer``, ``pulsemixer``, ``ossmixer``, and
    ``oss4mixer``.

    The default is ``software``, which does volume control inside Mopidy before
    the audio is sent to the audio output. This mixer does not affect the
    volume of any other audio playback on the system. It is the only mixer that
    will affect the audio volume if you're streaming the audio from Mopidy
    through Shoutcast.

    If you want to use a hardware mixer, try ``autoaudiomixer``. It attempts to
    select a sane hardware mixer for you automatically. When Mopidy is started,
    it will log what mixer ``autoaudiomixer`` selected, for example::

        INFO     Audio mixer set to "alsamixer" using track "Master"

    Setting the config value to blank turns off volume control.

.. confval:: audio/mixer_track

    Audio mixer track to use.

    Name of the mixer track to use. If this is not set we will try to find the
    master output track. As an example, using ``alsamixer`` you would typically
    set this to ``Master`` or ``PCM``.

.. confval:: audio/output

    Audio output to use.

    Expects a GStreamer sink. Typical values are ``autoaudiosink``,
    ``alsasink``, ``osssink``, ``oss4sink``, ``pulsesink``, and ``shout2send``,
    and additional arguments specific to each sink. You can use the command
    ``gst-inspect-0.10`` to see what output properties can be set on the sink.
    For example: ``gst-inspect-0.10 shout2send``

.. confval:: audio/visualizer

    Visualizer to use.

    Can be left blank if no visualizer is desired. Otherwise this expects a
    GStreamer visualizer. Typical values are ``monoscope``, ``goom``,
    ``goom2k1`` or one of the `libvisual`_ visualizers.

.. _libvisual: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-plugin-libvisual.html

.. confval:: logging/console_format

    The log format used for informational logging.

    See `the Python logging docs`_ for details on the format.

.. confval:: logging/debug_format

    The log format used for debug logging.

    See `the Python logging docs`_ for details on the format.

.. confval:: logging/debug_file

    The file to dump debug log data to when Mopidy is run with the
    :option:`mopidy --save-debug-log` option.

.. confval:: logging/config_file

    Config file that overrides all logging config values, see `the Python
    logging docs`_ for details.

.. confval:: loglevels/*

    The ``loglevels`` config section can be used to change the log level for
    specific parts of Mopidy during development or debugging. Each key in the
    config section should match the name of a logger. The value is the log
    level to use for that logger, one of ``debug``, ``info``, ``warning``,
    ``error``, or ``critical``.

.. confval:: proxy/hostname

    Proxy server to use for communication with the Internet.

    Currently only used by the Spotify extension.

.. confval:: proxy/username

    Username for the proxy server, if needed.

.. confval:: proxy/password

    Password for the proxy server, if needed.

.. _the Python logging docs: http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.config.html


Extension configuration
=======================

Mopidy's extensions have their own config values that you may want to tweak.
For the available config values, please refer to the docs for each extension.
Most, if not all, can be found at :ref:`ext`.

Mopidy extensions are enabled by default when they are installed. If you want
to disable an extension without uninstalling it, all extensions support the
``enabled`` config value even if it isn't explicitly documented by all
extensions. If the ``enabled`` config value is set to ``false`` the extension
will not be started. For example, to disable the Spotify extension, add the
following to your ``mopidy.conf``::

    [spotify]
    enabled = false


Advanced configurations
=======================

Custom audio sink
-----------------

If you have successfully installed GStreamer, and then run the ``gst-inspect``
or ``gst-inspect-0.10`` command, you should see a long listing of installed
plugins, ending in a summary line::

    $ gst-inspect-0.10
    ... long list of installed plugins ...
    Total count: 254 plugins (1 blacklist entry not shown), 1156 features

Next, you should be able to produce a audible tone by running::

    gst-launch-0.10 audiotestsrc ! audioresample ! autoaudiosink

If you cannot hear any sound when running this command, you won't hear any
sound from Mopidy either, as Mopidy by default uses GStreamer's
``autoaudiosink`` to play audio. Thus, make this work before you file a bug
against Mopidy.

If you for some reason want to use some other GStreamer audio sink than
``autoaudiosink``, you can set the :confval:`audio/output` config value to a
partial GStreamer pipeline description describing the GStreamer sink you want
to use.

Example ``mopidy.conf`` for using OSS4:

.. code-block:: ini

    [audio]
    output = oss4sink

Again, this is the equivalent of the following ``gst-inspect`` command, so make
this work first::

    gst-launch-0.10 audiotestsrc ! audioresample ! oss4sink


Streaming through SHOUTcast/Icecast
-----------------------------------

.. warning:: Known issue

   Currently, Mopidy does not handle end-of-track vs end-of-stream signalling
   in GStreamer correctly. This causes the SHOUTcast stream to be disconnected
   at the end of each track, rendering it quite useless. For further details,
   see :issue:`492`.

If you want to play the audio on another computer than the one running Mopidy,
you can stream the audio from Mopidy through an SHOUTcast or Icecast audio
streaming server. Multiple media players can then be connected to the streaming
server simultaneously. To use the SHOUTcast output, do the following:

#. Install, configure and start the Icecast server. It can be found in the
   ``icecast2`` package in Debian/Ubuntu.

#. Set the :confval:`audio/output` config value to ``lame ! shout2send``. An
   Ogg Vorbis encoder could be used instead of the lame MP3 encoder.

#. You might also need to change the ``shout2send`` default settings, run
   ``gst-inspect-0.10 shout2send`` to see the available settings. Most likely
   you want to change ``ip``, ``username``, ``password``, and ``mount``. For
   example, to set the username and password, use:

   .. code-block:: ini

       [audio]
       output = lame ! shout2send username="alice" password="secret"

Other advanced setups are also possible for outputs. Basically, anything you
can use with the ``gst-launch-0.10`` command can be plugged into
:confval:`audio/output`.


New configuration values
------------------------

Mopidy's config validator will stop you from defining any config values in
your config file that Mopidy doesn't know about. This may sound obnoxious,
but it helps us detect typos in your config, and deprecated config values that
should be removed or updated.

If you're extending Mopidy, and want to use Mopidy's configuration
system, you can add new sections to the config without triggering the config
validator. We recommend that you choose a good and unique name for the config
section so that multiple extensions to Mopidy can be used at the same time
without any danger of naming collisions.
