HTTP clients

Mopidy added an :ref:`HTTP frontend <http-frontend>` in 0.10 which provides the
building blocks needed for creating web clients for Mopidy with the help of a
WebSocket and a JavaScript library provided by Mopidy.

This page will list any HTTP/web Mopidy clients. If you've created one, please
notify us so we can include your client on this page.

See :ref:`http-frontend` for details on how to build your own web client.
