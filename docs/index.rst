Mopidy

Mopidy is a music server which can play music both from your :ref:`local hard
drive <local-backend>` and from :ref:`Spotify <spotify-backend>`. Searches
returns results from both your local hard drive and from Spotify, and you can
mix tracks from both sources in your play queue. Your Spotify playlists are
also available for use, though we don't support modifying them yet.

To control your music server, you can use the :ref:`Ubuntu Sound Menu
<ubuntu-sound-menu>` on the machine running Mopidy, any device on the same
network which can control UPnP MediaRenderers (see :ref:`upnp-clients`), or any
:ref:`MPD client <mpd-clients>`. MPD clients are available for most platforms,
including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.

To install Mopidy, start by reading :ref:`installation`.
