Mopidy

Mopidy is a music server which can play music both from multiple sources, like
your :ref:`local hard drive <ext-local>`, :ref:`radio streams <ext-stream>`,
and from Spotify and SoundCloud. Searches combines results from all music
sources, and you can mix tracks from all sources in your play queue. Your
playlists from Spotify or SoundCloud are also available for use.

To control your Mopidy music server, you can use one of Mopidy's :ref:`web
clients <http-clients>`, the :ref:`Ubuntu Sound Menu <ubuntu-sound-menu>`, any
device on the same network which can control :ref:`UPnP MediaRenderers
<upnp-clients>`, or any :ref:`MPD client <mpd-clients>`. MPD clients are
available for many platforms, including Windows, OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.

To get started with Mopidy, start by reading :ref:`installation`.
