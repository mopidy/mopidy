Mopidy is a music server which can play music both from multiple sources, like
your :ref:`local hard drive <ext-local>`, :ref:`radio streams <ext-stream>`,
and from :ref:`Spotify <ext-spotify>` and SoundCloud. Searches combines results
from all music sources, and you can mix tracks from all sources in your play
queue. Your playlists from Spotify or SoundCloud are also available for use.

To control your Mopidy music server, you can use one of Mopidy's :ref:`web
clients <http-clients>`, the :ref:`Ubuntu Sound Menu <ubuntu-sound-menu>`, any
device on the same network which can control :ref:`UPnP MediaRenderers
<upnp-clients>`, or any :ref:`MPD client <mpd-clients>`. MPD clients are
available for many platforms, including Windows, OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.

To get started with Mopidy, start by reading :ref:`installation`.
