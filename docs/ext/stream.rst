Mopidy-Stream
*************

Mopidy-Stream is an extension for playing streaming music. It is bundled with
Mopidy and enabled by default.

This backend does not provide a library or playlist storage. It simply accepts
any URI added to Mopidy's tracklist that matches any of the protocols in the
:confval:`stream/protocols` config value. It then tries to retrieve metadata
and play back the URI using GStreamer. For example, if you're using an MPD
client, you'll just have to find your clients "add URI" interface, and provide
it with the URI of a stream.

In addition to playing streams, the extension also understands how to extract
streams from a lot of playlist formats. This is convenient as most Internet
radio stations links to playlists instead of directly to the radio streams.

If you're having trouble playing back a stream, run the ``mopidy deps``
command to check if you have all relevant GStreamer plugins installed.
