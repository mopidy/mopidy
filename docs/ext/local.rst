Mopidy-Local

Mopidy-Local is an extension for playing music from your local music archive.
It is bundled with Mopidy and enabled by default. Though, you'll have to scan
your music collection to build a cache of metadata before the Mopidy-Local
will be able to play your music.

This backend handles URIs starting with ``local:``.


.. _generating-a-local-library:

Generating a local library
==========================

The command :command:`mopidy local scan` will scan the path set in the
:confval:`local/media_dir` config value for any audio files and build a
library of metadata.

To make a local library for your music available for Mopidy:

#. Ensure that the :confval:`local/media_dir` config value points to where your
   music is located. Check the current setting by running::

    mopidy config

#. Scan your media library.::

    mopidy local scan

#. Start Mopidy, find the music library in a client, and play some local music!


Pluggable library support
=========================

Local libraries are fully pluggable. What this means is that users may opt to
disable the current default library ``json``, replacing it with a third
party one. When running :command:`mopidy local scan` Mopidy will populate
whatever the current active library is with data. Only one library may be
active at a time.

To create a new library provider you must create class that implements the
:class:`mopidy.local.Library` interface and install it in the extension
registry under ``local:library``. Any data that the library needs to store on
disc should be stored in :confval:`local/data_dir` using the library name as
part of the filename or directory to avoid any conflicts.


Configuration
=============

See :ref:`config` for general help on configuring Mopidy.

.. literalinclude:: ../../mopidy/local/ext.conf
    :language: ini

.. confval:: local/enabled

    If the local extension should be enabled or not.

.. confval:: local/library

    Local library provider to use, change this if you want to use a third party

.. confval:: local/media_dir

    Path to directory with local media files.

.. confval:: local/data_dir
