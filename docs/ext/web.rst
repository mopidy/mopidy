was added in Mopidy 0.19, and optionally using the :ref:`http-api`.

This list is moderated and updated on a regular basis. If you want your package

Other web clients
=================

There's also some other web clients for Mopidy that use the :ref:`http-api`,
but isn't installable using ``pip``:

- `Apollo Player <https://github.com/samcreate/Apollo-Player>`_
- `JukePi <https://github.com/meantimeit/jukepi>`_

In addition, there's several web based MPD clients, which doesn't use the
:ref:`ext-http` frontend at all, but connect to Mopidy through our
:ref:`ext-mpd` frontend. For a list of those, see :ref:`mpd-web-clients`.
