was added in Mopidy 0.19, and optionally using the :ref:`http-api`.

Other web clients

There are also some other web clients for Mopidy that use the :ref:`http-api`
but are not installable using ``pip``:

- `Apollo Player <https://github.com/samcreate/Apollo-Player>`_

In addition, there are several web based MPD clients, which doesn't use the
:ref:`ext-http` frontend at all, but connect to Mopidy through our
:ref:`ext-mpd` frontend. For a list of those, see :ref:`mpd-web-clients`.
