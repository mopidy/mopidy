Mopidy is a music server which can play music from `Spotify
<http://www.spotify.com/>`_ or from your local hard drive. To search for music
in Spotify's vast archive, manage playlists, and play music, you can use your browser 
or an `MPD client <http://mpd.wikia.com/>`_. MPD clients are available for most
platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.
