Mopidy is a music server which can play music both from your local hard drive
and from `Spotify <http://www.spotify.com/>`_. Searches returns results from
both your local hard drive and from Spotify, and you can mix tracks from both
sources in your play queue. Your Spotify playlists are also available for use,
though we don't support modifying them yet.

To control your music server, you can use the Ubuntu Sound Menu on the machine
running Mopidy, any device on the same network which supports the DLNA media
controller spec (with the help of Rygel in addition to Mopidy), or any `MPD
client <http://mpd.wikia.com/>`_. MPD clients are available for most platforms,
including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.

To install Mopidy, check out
